## About the Project 
This repository features a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project for the 2024 Formula 1 season. The project utilizes Python and pandas to clean and process official datasets related to races, drivers, teams, and fan votes, subsequently presenting important insights through an interactive dashboard with matplotlib and seaborn.  

-Loads and cleans all official F1 2024 data CSVs.  
-Analyzes driver points, team performance, fastest laps, and starting grid effects.  
-Visualizes fan voting trends and finishing patterns across tracks.  
-Presents multiple charts in a professional grid dashboard layout.  
-Includes heatmaps and barplots for deep performance comparisons.  
-Saves summary figures for reporting and presentation.
